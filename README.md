# Background on the Dental Insurance Market in the United States

This document provides a detailed overview of the dental insurance market in the United States. It includes information on how dental practices are typically organized, as well as the structure of the dental insurance market.

## Dental Practice Organization in the US

Dentists in the United States work in a variety of settings:

1. **Private Practice**: The majority of dentists, approximately 80%, operate in a private practice environment. This includes solo practitioners as well as partnerships and small group practices. These dentists handle all aspects of running the practice, from patient care to business operations.

2. **Dental Service Organizations (DSOs)**: A growing segment of dentists work with DSOs, organizations that provide business support and management services to allow dentists to focus on patient care. Dentists working in a DSO do not handle the business operations of the practice.

3. **Hospitals and Community Clinics**: A smaller percentage of dentists work in hospitals or community clinics, which may offer a broad range of medical services including dental care.

## General Characteristics of the US Dental Insurance Market

1. **Separate Insurance Plans**: In the US, dental insurance is typically separate from medical insurance. This means that individuals often need to purchase separate plans to cover dental services.

2. **Employer-Provided Insurance**: Many Americans receive dental insurance through their employers. Many companies offer dental insurance as part of their employee benefits packages.

3. **Insurance Networks**: Many dental insurance plans operate on a network basis, where there is a network of dentists who provide services at discounted rates.

4. **Payment Structure**: Dental insurance typically involves monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and copayments or coinsurance for certain services.

5. **Coverage**: Dental insurance coverage typically includes preventive and basic services and some major services. However, the specifics can vary depending on the insurance plan.

[Nasse et al 2020](Documents/References/Nasseh%20et%20al._2020.pdf): An increase in commercial dental insurance market concentration leads to consolidation among dentists rather than owning their own practices.
